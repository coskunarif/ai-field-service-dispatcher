# QA Orchestrator

**SCOPE: This skill performs manual/functional QA only -- verifying that the application actually works by interacting with it as a real user would (browser, API calls). Do NOT run or report on CI checks, linting, ESLint, typecheck, unit tests, or any static analysis. Those are handled by separate workflows.**

## Step 1: Load Configuration

Read `.factory/skills/qa/config.yaml` for environment URLs, credentials, personas, and app definitions.

## Step 2: Determine Target Environment

Use the `default_target` from config unless the user specifies a different environment.
Respect any environment restrictions listed in config.yaml.

For Gainhelm, the default target is `local_dev`. When testing a PR branch, the agent
must test the checked-out branch code. Since this project does **not** use Vercel/Netlify
preview deployments, start the local dev server with the configured `build_command` and
test against `http://localhost:3005`.

## Step 3: Analyze Git Diff

Run `git diff` to determine what changed. Map changed files to apps using the
`path_patterns` in config.yaml.

Files that do not match ANY app's path_patterns (e.g., `.factory/skills/**`, `docs/**`,
`.github/**`, config files) are NOT associated with any app. Do NOT run app test flows for
them.

For each affected app:

- Run ONLY that app's flows from its sub-skill
- Generate ADDITIONAL targeted tests based on the specific changes in the diff

For apps NOT affected by the diff:

- Do NOT load or run their module. Do NOT run their flows. Do NOT run their pre-flight checks.
- They are completely out of scope.

If NO app is affected by the diff (e.g., docs-only, CI-only, or skill-only changes), report
as INCONCLUSIVE: "No app code changed -- QA not applicable for this diff." Do NOT run any
app flows.

## Step 4: Pre-flight Checks (app-specific only)

Run pre-flight checks ONLY for the apps that are affected by the diff.

For the **web** app:

1. Start the dev server: `PORT=3005 npm start` (or the configured `build_command`)
2. Poll `http://localhost:3005` until it returns HTTP 200
3. If the server fails to start, report BLOCKED with the stderr output

For the **backend** app:

1. Start the backend server: `cd api && npm start`
2. Poll `http://localhost:3000` until the `/waitlist` endpoint responds
3. If the backend fails to start, report BLOCKED with the stderr output

Do NOT run pre-flight checks for apps that are NOT affected. If a pre-flight check fails
for an affected app, report it as BLOCKED with the specific error and remediation steps,
but still proceed with other affected apps.

## Step 5: Execute Diff-Relevant Flows Only

For each app that IS affected by the diff, read its sub-skill from
`.factory/skills/qa-<app-name>/SKILL.md`.

The sub-skill contains a MENU of available test flows. You must:

1. Read the diff carefully and identify which flows are relevant to the change
2. Run those flows PLUS any adjacent flows that verify the change integrates correctly
3. Do NOT run completely unrelated flows
4. If no existing flow covers the change, write a NEW ad-hoc test that directly verifies the changed behavior
5. Do NOT run unit tests, lint, typecheck, or any automated test suite. This is manual/functional QA only.

## Step 6: Evidence Capture

After each significant test step, capture evidence. Use **text snapshots as primary evidence**
-- they render inline in the PR comment with no image hosting issues.

For web apps (agent-browser):

- Use `agent-browser snapshot` to capture the page's accessibility tree as text evidence
- Save screenshot files to `./qa-results/$RUN_ID/` for the artifact upload
- Do NOT embed `![image](url)` markdown in the report. Instead, mention the filename and note
  that it is available in the downloadable artifacts.

For API/backend tests (curl):

- Capture the JSON response body and the HTTP status code
- Embed relevant snippets in the report as fenced code blocks

Evidence quality rules:

- Focus on the RELEVANT content. Trim snapshots to the meaningful part.
- Label each snapshot clearly: what it shows and why it matters for the test.
- NEVER embed broken image links. If you cannot verify an image URL will resolve, use text evidence instead.
- The workflow uploads all files in `./qa-results/` as a downloadable artifact -- reference that for visual evidence.

## Step 7: Test Quality Gate

TEST QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:

1. CHANGE-SPECIFIC FIRST. At least half your tests should directly verify the behavioral change in the diff.
2. INTEGRATION TESTS ARE VALID. Tests that verify the change integrates with existing features are good.
3. NO UNRELATED FLOWS. Do NOT test features completely unrelated to the diff.
4. NO AUTOMATED TEST SUITES. Do NOT run vitest, npm test, or CI-style checks. This is manual/functional QA only.
5. NEGATIVE TESTS. Include at least 1 test verifying error handling or boundary conditions related to the change.
6. INTERACTIVE TESTING. Test by actually interacting with the app as a real user would.
7. INCONCLUSIVE IF UNSURE. If you cannot articulate what the PR changes, mark as INCONCLUSIVE rather than PASS.

## Step 8: Handle Failures

**Never silently skip a flow.** If a flow cannot complete, report it as BLOCKED with what was
tried and how the user can fix it. Then continue to the next flow -- never abort the entire
run for a single failure.

## Step 9: Generate Report

Generate the report at `./qa-results/report.md` using `.factory/skills/qa/REPORT-TEMPLATE.md`.

The report MUST follow the template. Key rules:

- Start with `## QA Report` heading followed by the test results table
- Result column MUST use emojis: :white_check_mark: PASS, :x: FAIL, :no_entry: BLOCKED, :warning: FLAKY, :grey_question: INCONCLUSIVE
- Keep it CONCISE. The table + a short "Action Required" section (if any) + collapsed screenshots = the entire report.
- Do NOT include: "Behavioral Change Summary", "Blocked Flows" prose, "Info" metadata table, or verbose explanations of what the diff does.
- Do NOT report setup/prerequisite steps (building, startup, launching) as test rows. Those are means to the end, not test cases.
- Put ALL evidence in a single collapsed `<details>` block
- For web evidence: embed accessibility tree snapshots as text. Reference screenshot filenames for visual proof (available in downloadable artifacts). Do NOT use `![image](url)` markdown.

## Step 10: Suggest Skill Updates (Failure Learning)

After generating the report, check if any BLOCKED or FAIL results revealed a **testing
environment insight** that would help future QA runs succeed. This is about learning how the
testing environment works, NOT about fixing bad selectors or skill typos.

**Good suggestions** (environment/workflow knowledge):

- "The dev server requires `PORT=3005 npm start`, not `npm run dev`"
- "The setup page blocks access for emails not in the waitlist; QA must seed the waitlist first"
- "Google Calendar validation follows redirects to accounts.google.com; use a public calendar URL"

**Bad suggestions** (skill bugs, not environment insights -- do NOT suggest these):

- "Selector data-testid=foo doesn't exist" -- fix the skill directly
- "The button text changed from X to Y" -- that's expected from the PR diff

Format as a table with severity, collapsible fix prompts, and a count in the heading:

## Suggested Skill Updates (N issues found)

| #   | Severity        | File     | Issue               | Fix Prompt                                                                           |
| --- | --------------- | -------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | <emoji> <level> | `<file>` | <short description> | <details><summary>Copy</summary><br>`<full droid prompt to fix the issue>`</details> |

Severity levels:

- `🔴 Breaking` -- Causes test failures every run (wrong URL, wrong auth method, missing required step)
- `🟡 Degraded` -- Causes intermittent failures or suboptimal behavior (timing issues, rate limits)
- `🔵 Info` -- New knowledge that improves future runs but doesn't cause failures

Each Fix Prompt must be a self-contained instruction that Droid can execute directly when pasted.

Do NOT suggest updates for failures already covered in Known Failure Modes, bad selectors, or
expected behavior changes from the PR. If no genuinely new environment insights were
discovered, omit this section entirely.

For this project, `failure_learning` is set to `suggest_in_report`. Include the table in the
report only. Do NOT write `qa-results/skill-updates.json`.

## Step 11: Cleanup Test Data

If `cleanup.auto_cleanup` is true in config.yaml, remove QA-created test data after the report
is generated. For Gainhelm, run SQL DELETE statements against the configured DATABASE_URL for
rows where `email` matches the QA-created patterns:

- `qa+newuser_%@gainhelm.com`
- `qa+owner_%@gainhelm.com`
- `qa+restricted_%@gainhelm.com`

Target tables: `waitlist_leads`, `gainhelm_contexts`, `gainhelm_dispatch_logs`.

Only delete rows matching these exact patterns. Never delete production data. If the
database is not connected, skip cleanup and note it in the report.

Cleanup failures should be reported as FAIL in the report with the SQL error, but they
should not block the overall QA result from being posted.
